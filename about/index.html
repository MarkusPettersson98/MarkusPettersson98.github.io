currently working for <a href=https://mullvad.net>Mullvad VPN</a>. Raised in Arvika, where my journey of
building computers and tinkering with electronics began. Computers & video games
allowed me to stay connected with my friends, despite growing up in a rural
area, and I quickly grew very fond of these machines. Learning to tinker with
them was not only fascinating in itself, but building your own gaming computer
was more cost effective than buying a pre-built dito. An important
property for a kid who only recieved paychecks twice each year: birthday &
christmas.</p><p>Despite being drawn to computers and video games all my childhood, I didn&rsquo;t
write my first line of code until I was ~17. I always thought that I wanted to
get into game development, but since I never knew how to approach the subject
(nor did anyone around me back then either), the inertia was simply to big to
overcome on my own. I would walk this earth, oblivious about programming, until
I took an introductory programming course at my gymnasium held by an old-school
LISP hacker. His passion made learning fun, and I got introduced to more
programming languages and computing history than I&rsquo;ve ever been in a single
course ever since. While the curriculum was focused on writing Basic, C and a
bit of C++, he indoctrinated us to the clever humor of Douglas Adams, the
sarcasm of <a href=https://xkcd.com/>xkcd</a>, and programmer communities such as <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/>Hacker News</a>. A whole new
world opened up right in front of our eyes, and I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since.</p><p>Learning programming on my own has been infinitely easier ever since. I will be
forever grateful for free and open source software, which allow me to keep
learning about the tools I use everyday. I am certain the communities around
open source projects changed my life for the better. But even more importantly,
thank you Stefan.</p><h2 id=interests>Interests</h2><p>I love <strong>programming languages</strong> and <strong>developer tools</strong>.
I like teaching computers to do arduous work for me, and there are just so many interesting topics to learn while doing so.</p><p>To strengthen my knowledge about <strong>functional programming</strong>, <strong>type theory</strong> &
<strong>compilers</strong>, I pursued a master&rsquo;s degree in <a href=https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx>Computer Science at Chalmers</a>. It was
a great and humbling experience, and it introduced me to lots of interesting
subjects and people. I&rsquo;ve learnt how a compiler works, and I would even go so
far as to say that I know <abbr title=" A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, also known as a 'burrito' among domain experts.">what a monad is</abbr>.
