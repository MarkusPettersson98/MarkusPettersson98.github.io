## Me {#me}

**Markus Pettersson**, 24 y.o. **software engineer** living in **Gothenburg**,
**Sweden**. Born and raised in Arvika, where my journey of building computers and
tinkering with electronics began. Computers &amp; video games allowed me to stay
connected with my friends, and so I grew very fond of these machines. Learning
to tinker with them was not only fascinating in itself, but you could save a
few <abbr title=" Swedish Crowns">sek</abbr> by building your own computer, which was
important for a kid whose only significant income consisted of birthday gifts
and christmas presents.

It was not really until last year of upper secondary school that I wrote my
first line of code. Which is weird, since I always wanted to get into game
development. I guess it was because I did not know how to approach the subject,
nor did anyone around me until then. That was until this great and super
passionate teacher, Stefan Holm, showed me how to write Basic, C and a bit of
C++. He introduced me to the clever humor of Douglas Adams, the sarcasm of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/),
and communities of programmers such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). A whole new world opened
right in front of my eyes, and I've been hooked ever since.

I will be forevery grateful for free and open source software, from where I
could keep learning about the things I like the most. I am certain the
communities around open source projects changed my life for the better.


## Interests, motivation {#interests-motivation}

My interest lie in **programming languages** and **developer tools**.
Who doesn't like when computers do arduous, and maybe even valuable work for them?
If computers can not automate a certain process, they should at least gently guide the user through the process.
That's why I appreciate projects like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), that build on a collective of knowledge from a truly **open community** to reshape the old and crude ways of working, in this case for systems programming.
Now that I think about it, I haven't heard the phrase "[Bending the Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazvK39Oc4U)" in a while.
Maybe Rust's ideas about safety has become more and more normalized since its 1.0 release.
What do I know.

To strengthen my knowledge about **functional programming**, **type theory**,
**compilers** and all of that jazz I enrolled in the [Computer Science master at
Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx) in 2020, which I'm about to graduate from this year (hopefully). It
has been a great experience, with lots of interesting courses and
lecturers/professors. I would claim that it has greatly improved my in-depth
knowledge on all of the aforementioned topics. I've learnt how a compiler works,
and I would even go so far as to say that I know what a <abbr title=" A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, also known as a 'burrito' among domain experts.">monad</abbr> is. I hope to use my skills to build [software you can
love](https://kristoff.it/blog/software-you-can-love/) one day, I'll just have to figure out what that could be.
