## Me {#me}

**Markus Pettersson**, 25 y.o. **software engineer** living in **Gothenburg**, Sweden
currently working for [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net). Raised in Arvika, where my journey of
building computers and tinkering with electronics began. Computers &amp; video games
allowed me to stay connected with my friends, despite growing up in a rural
area, and I quickly grew very fond of these machines. Learning to tinker with
them was not only fascinating in itself, but building your own gaming computer
was more cost effective than buying a pre-built dito. An important
property for a kid who only recieved paychecks twice each year: birthday &amp;
christmas.

Despite being drawn to computers and video games all my childhood, I didn't
write my first line of code until I was ~17. I always thought that I wanted to
get into game development, but since I never knew how to approach the subject
(nor did anyone around me back then either), the inertia was simply to big to
overcome on my own. I would walk this earth, oblivious about programming, until
I took an introductory programming course at my gymnasium held by an old-school
LISP hacker. His passion made learning fun, and I got introduced to more
programming languages and computing history than I've ever been in a single
course ever since. While the curriculum was focused on writing Basic, C and a
bit of C++, he indoctrinated us to the clever humor of Douglas Adams, the
sarcasm of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), and programmer communities such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). A whole new
world opened up right in front of our eyes, and I've been hooked ever since.

Learning programming on my own has been infinitely easier ever since. I will be
forever grateful for free and open source software, which allow me to keep
learning about the tools I use everyday. I am certain the communities around
open source projects changed my life for the better. But even more importantly,
thank you Stefan.


## Interests {#interests}

I love  **programming languages** and **developer tools**.
I like teaching computers to do arduous work for me, and there are just so many interesting topics to learn while doing so.

To strengthen my knowledge about **functional programming**, **type theory** &amp;
**compilers**, I pursued a master's degree in [Computer Science at Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx). It was
a great and humbling experience, and it introduced me to lots of interesting
subjects and people. I've learnt how a compiler works, and I would even go so
far as to say that I know <abbr title=" A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, also known as a 'burrito' among domain experts.">what a monad is</abbr>. I hope to use my skills to build [software you can love](https://kristoff.it/blog/software-you-can-love/).
