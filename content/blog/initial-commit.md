This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.

I intended to start this project way back when [Google released .dev domains to the public](https://blog.google/technology/developers/hello-dev/).
I managed to register a `.dev` domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him. How time flies.

I do not know what this site will be used for, except for hosting my resume and a few links to portfolis such as Github, in case anyone would care.
Maybe I'll get around to document my foray into ergonomic keyboards, or write about esoteric programming languages I find interesting.

Until next time.
