I've finally settled on a permanent domain: [marqs.io](https://marqs.io)

It has multiple qualities which I like

-   It's somewhat short
-   It's obscure enough that I haven't seen this particular wordplay on "Markus" before, which makes it feel a tad bit more authentic
-   It's personal enough that I actually would want to use it as my personal email domain

Since registering the domain on Nov 19 I've already comitted to it far more than my previous domain, for example associating it with my [GPG key ðŸ”‘](/gpg/marqs.asc).


## Domain Registrars {#domain-registrars}

I tought that I would try something new, and so I registered my new domain with
[gandi](https://www.gandi.net/). As a first-time customer, I've been pleasantly surprised! Their pricing
is fair, their cPanel is straightforward, they don't seem to use trackers on
their website, DNSSEC is really easy to enable and they support [security keys](https://docs.gandi.net/en/account_management/security/security_key.html)
for MFA! ðŸŽ‰

I've previously used [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) and the swedish domain registrar [loopia.se](https://www.loopia.se/).
Namecheap was okay, they are generally very cheap and their cPanel is okay. I
was quite disappointed with Loopia from the start, which is why I ever only
registered 1 domain with them. They are quite expensive and they don't even
support any form of 2FA/MFA. And no, I don't view having [BankID](https://www.bankid.com/) as a good reason
to skip providing MFA for other types of login.

In general I don't really like the state of affairs when it comes to domain
registrars. They always try to upsell you on extra features (or even new
domains!), and they all seem to track you for unknown reasons. It's a bit sad to
see both [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) being on high alert when I'm adding an
A-record through their cPanel.


## Migration {#migration}

Currently, I'm hosting an out-dated version of this website at my old domain
[datamaskin.se](https://datamaskin.se) in addition to this new website. When that domain expires (Feb
12 2024), the old site will be forever unavailable and redacted from this blog
post.
