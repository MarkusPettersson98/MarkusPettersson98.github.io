## Israel and network analysis

[Palestine is a laboratory](https://antonyloewenstein.com/books/the-palestine-laboratory-how-israel-exports-the-technology-of-occupation-around-the-world/) where Israel try out and perfect new weapons in the name of defending the West.
Like the ['war' in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war), this did not start on 7 October 2023 but has been ever ongoing throughout the latter half of the 1900's, continuing through today.
What is new is the widespread deployment of A.I. in direct combat, a rapidly growing industry as the world spirals into conflict[^palantir][^helsing].

To understand why these tools are so powerful, we need to understand what they are targetting.
One of the great promises of cryptography is to preserve [secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy) in communication over untrusted channels.
Modern cryptography is so good and widely depolyed[^wg-signal-aes256] that it is [infeasible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack#Theoretical_limits) to crack even one encrypted channel by brute-force, even for nation-state actors.
But depending on who you are targetting, the content of the message might not matter.
Many message exchanges still [leak valuable metadata](https://emmatrowbridge.github.io/Excuse-Me-Your-Data-Is-Leaking/2025/05/27/Exposed-by-Metadata.html), such as who you are communicating with - and here is where A.I. comes in - even what could _possibly_ be encrypted.


### Case study - the Lavender database

[Lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_targeting_in_the_Gaza_Strip#Lavender).

### CIA kills people based on metadata (citation needed)

And this is not a one-off incident or a hypothetical threat for the rest of us non-Palestinians.
The former head of the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency), Michael Hayden, has publicly stated that ["We (the U.S.) kill people based on metadata"](https://cyber-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/We-Kill-People-Based-on-Metadata.pdf).
Remember Snowden? He leaked documents confirming that the NSA record phone calls and internet traffic on all U.S. citizens, and for that he will spend the remainder of his life in exile.
Metadata is serious business.

I've said this before, and I will keep reiterating: Gaza showed the world what the modern imperialist hegemony is capable of, and the forces they unleashed on the people of Palestine do not discriminate - they will be coming right back at us.

## Why TOR care, and so should you

["Surveillance as a Service: The Global Impact of Israeli “Defense” Technologies on Privacy and Human Rights"](https://blog.torproject.org/surveillance-as-a-service-global-impact-of-israeli-defense-technologies-on-privacy-human-rights/)

### Solidarity argument

### Maybenot

TOR does not only preserve the secrecy of your communication, they are actively working on integrating [maybenot](https://github.com/maybenot-io/maybenot), a framework for traffic analysis denses, as an anti-fingrprinting measures in the TOR-browser.
I.e. making it harder for any outside observer to record and make sense of your internet activity (metadata).

## Freedom of association
* Inskrivet i Sveriges grundlag.
### Did not come for free
### Oppression in Sweden
#### Past (historically)
* Sveriges förvar av kommunister/radikala anarkister under andra världskriget
* I.B. / Jan Guillo
* Kommunister åsiktsregistrerades fram till ~1990. Var under uppsikt av SÄPO.

#### Present
* Bristande vandel
- Klimataktivister hotas redan med domar med utvisning som straff.
* Sedan 202x krävs inget domstolsbesult för att en medborgara ska kunna avlysnnas i hemlighet. Det här gäller ända ner till 15 års ålder.

#### Future
* Polisen samarbetar med Palantir
- Palantir är rövhål
- Polisen vet om att det är kontroversiellt, så de vill inte erkänna det öppet.
* Parallel med bloggposten om den imperialistiska boomerangen
* Självcensur, när man vet att man är kartlagd

## Final words
- Be vary
- Use TOR
- Find *actually* safe spaces to organise. The regular internet and/or services owned by mega corps are not it.
    - Yet again, even if WhatsApp claim to be E2E encrypted and are able to hand over metadata to law enforcement, we know from first-hand accounts that CIA may kill you.

Malicious use of A.I. has once again made it clear that we need to find alternative spaces for social justice movements to organize - the internet is not safe - and that's a good thing.

### Poem (ending with a bit of hope)

> When the Nazis came for the communists,<br>
> I kept quiet; I wasn't a communist.<br>

> When they came for the trade unionists, I kept quiet;<br>
> I wasn't a trade unionist.<br>
>
> When they locked up the social democrats, I kept quiet;<br>
> I wasn't a social democrat.<br>
>
> When they locked up the Jews, I kept quiet;<br>
> I wasn't a Jew.<br>

> When they came for me, there was no one left to protest<br>

## Random thoughts (TODO: delete)
### Israel and network analysis
- One promise of cryptography: to preserve [secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy) in communication over untrusted channels.
