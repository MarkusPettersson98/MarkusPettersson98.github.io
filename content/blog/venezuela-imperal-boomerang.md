On the 3rd of January the U.S. invaded Venezuela and illegally abducted Nicolás Maduro, while being very blatant about the [profit motive](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkr4y717k7o) driving this intervention.

Shortly thereafter, peaceful protestors were arrested for speaking up against said intervention.

The arresting of protestors is totally expected; U.S. always was an imperialist, fascist state since it was founded by colonial settlers.
And if the suppression of dissidents in the West came as a surprise to anyone, now is a good time to get acquainted with the Imperial Boomerang:
> And then one fine day the bourgeoisie is awakened by a terrific boomerang effect: the gestapos are busy, the prisons fill up, the torturers standing around the racks invent, refine, discuss. People are surprised, they become indignant. They say: "How strange! But never mind—it's Nazism, it will pass!" And they wait, and they hope; and they hide the truth from themselves, that it is barbarism, the supreme barbarism, the crowning barbarism that sums up all the daily barbarisms; that it is Nazism, yes, but that before they were its victims, they were its accomplices; that they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, that they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples; that they have cultivated that Nazism, that they are responsible for it, and that before engulfing the whole edifice of Western, Christian civilization in its reddened waters, it oozes, seeps, and trickles from every crack.<br>

Staying silent is being complicit. Staying silent is accepting a fascist hegemony.
Gaza was a clear signal to the leaders of the world that the international community will not intervene even in the face of a genocide, so why would they oppose forceful capture of natural resources in South America?
U.S. has to get out of Venezuela. [Out of all of South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine). [Out of Sweden](https://www.government.se/government-policy/military-defence/defence-cooperation-agreement-with-the-united-states/). Fuck off.

Resisting will not get easier, but they can not arrest us all. Their economy will literally fall apart without us.
Show unconditional solidarity with all oppressed of the world.
Don't mourn, organize!
