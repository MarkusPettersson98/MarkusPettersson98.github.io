Welcome stranger!
I'm Markus ☯.

This is where I share pieces of myself: [[/blog][Blog posts]], [[/resume][my resume]], open source projects and so on.

This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.

I intended to start this project way back when [[https://blog.google/technology/developers/hello-dev/][Google released .dev domains to the public]].
I managed to register a =.dev= domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him. How time flies.

I do not know what this site will be used for, except for hosting my resume, a few links to portfolis such as Github, and maybe a GPG fingerprint in case anyone would care.
Maybe I'll get around to document my foray into ergonomic keyboards, or write about esoteric programming languages I find interesting.

Until next time.
