Welcome stranger!
I'm Markus ☯.

This is where I share pieces of myself: [[/blog][Blog posts]], [[/resume][my resume]], open source projects and so on.

** Me
Markus Pettersson, 23 y.o. *software engineering student* living in *Gothenburg*, *Sweden*.
Born and raised in Arvika, where I grew fond of computers and tinkering with electronics.
Because computers play games, and you could save a few /sek/ by building your own computer.
Very important for a child who likes to humble brag about graphics settings.

It was not really until last year of upper secondary school that I {{{abbr(encountered programming, Wrote my first line of code)}}}.
Which is weird, since I always wanted to get into game dev but never bothered.
I guess it was because I did not know how, nor did anyone around me.

** Interests, motivation
My interest lie in *programming languages* and *developer tools*.
Who doesn't like when computers do a lot of work for them?
If computers can not automate a certain process, they should atleast gently guide the user through the process.
That's why I respectfully appreciate projects like [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]], which build on a collective of knowledge from a truly *open community* to reshape what systems programming can look like.
Now that I think about it, I haven't heard the phrase "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazvK39Oc4U][Bending the Curve]]" in a while.
Maybe Rust's ideas about safety has become more and more normalized since its 1.0 release.
What do I know.

To strengthen my knowledge about *functional programming*, *type theory*, *compilers* and all of that jazz I enrolled in the [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx][Computer Science master at Chalmers]] in 2020, which I'm about to graduate from this year (hopefully).
It has been a great experience, with lots of interesting courses and lecturers/professors.
I would claim that it has greatly improved my in-depth knowledge on all of the aforementioned topics.
I certainly know how a compiler works, and I would even go so far as to say that I know what a {{{abbr(monad, A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\, also known as a 'burrito' among domain experts.)}}} is. I hope to use my skills to build something cool one day, I'll just have to figure out what.

This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.

I intended to start this project way back when [[https://blog.google/technology/developers/hello-dev/][Google released .dev domains to the public]].
I managed to register a =.dev= domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him. How time flies.

I do not know what this site will be used for, except for hosting my resume and a few links to portfolis such as Github, in case anyone would care.
Maybe I'll get around to document my foray into ergonomic keyboards, or write about esoteric programming languages I find interesting.

Until next time.
