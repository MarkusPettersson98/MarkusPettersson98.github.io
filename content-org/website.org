** Me
*Markus Pettersson*, 25 y.o. *software engineer* living in *Gothenburg*, Sweden
currently working for [[https://mullvad.net][Mullvad VPN]]. Raised in Arvika, where my journey of
building computers and tinkering with electronics began. Computers & video games
allowed me to stay connected with my friends, despite growing up in a rural
area, and I quickly grew very fond of these machines. Learning to tinker with
them was not only fascinating in itself, but building your own gaming computer
was more cost effective than buying a pre-built dito. An important
property for a kid who only recieved paychecks twice each year: birthday &
christmas.

Despite being drawn to computers and video games all my childhood, I didn't
write my first line of code until I was ~17. I always thought that I wanted to
get into game development, but since I never knew how to approach the subject
(nor did anyone around me back then either), the inertia was simply to big to
overcome on my own. I would walk this earth, oblivious about programming, until
I took an introductory programming course at my gymnasium held by an old-school
LISP hacker. His passion made learning fun, and I got introduced to more
programming languages and computing history than I've ever been in a single
course ever since. While the curriculum was focused on writing Basic, C and a
bit of C++, he indoctrinated us to the clever humor of Douglas Adams, the
sarcasm of [[https://xkcd.com/][xkcd]], and programmer communities such as [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]]. A whole new
world opened up right in front of our eyes, and I've been hooked ever since.

Learning programming on my own has been infinitely easier ever since. I will be
forever grateful for free and open source software, which allow me to keep
learning about the tools I use everyday. I am certain the communities around
open source projects changed my life for the better. But even more importantly,
thank you Stefan.

** Interests
I love  *programming languages* and *developer tools*.
I like teaching computers to do arduous work for me, and there are just so many interesting topics to learn while doing so.

To strengthen my knowledge about *functional programming*, *type theory* &
*compilers*, I pursued a master's degree in [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx][Computer Science at Chalmers]]. It was
a great and humbling experience, and it introduced me to lots of interesting
subjects and people. I've learnt how a compiler works, and I would even go so
far as to say that I know {{{abbr(what a monad is, A monad is just a monoid in
the category of endofunctors\, also known as a 'burrito' among domain
experts.)}}}. I hope to use my skills to build [[https://kristoff.it/blog/software-you-can-love/][software you can love]].

** Resume
You can find a PDF version of my resume ðŸ‘‰ [[/cv.pdf][here]] ðŸ‘ˆ

And of course, the sauce: cv.{[[/cv.tex][tex]], [[/cv.txt][txt]], [[https://github.com/MarkusPettersson98/cv][git]]}

** This site
Built with [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], themed with [[https://github.com/MarkusPettersson98/hugo-bearblog][my fork]] of the [[https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog][hugo-bearblog theme]].

The original [[https://bearblog.dev/][Bear Blog Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”]] is created by [[https://herman.bearblog.dev/][Herman Martinus]].

This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.

I intended to start this project way back when [[https://blog.google/technology/developers/hello-dev/][Google released .dev domains to the public]].
I managed to register a =.dev= domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him. How time flies.

I do not know what this site will be used for, except for hosting my resume and a few links to portfolis such as Github, in case anyone would care.
Maybe I'll get around to document my foray into ergonomic keyboards, or write about esoteric programming languages I find interesting.

Until next time.

** I got a new domain ðŸŽ‰
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: new-domain
:EXPORT_DATE: 2023-11-29
:END:
I've finally settled on a permanent domain: [[https://marqs.io][marqs.io]]

It has multiple qualities which I like

- It's somewhat short
- It's obscure enough that I haven't seen this particular wordplay on "Markus" before, which makes it feel a tad bit more authentic
- It's personal enough that I actually would want to use it as my personal email domain

Since registering the domain on Nov 19 I've already comitted to it far more than my previous domain, for example associating it with my [[/gpg/marqs.asc][GPG key ðŸ”‘]].

*** Domain Registrars
I tought that I would try something new, and so I registered my new domain with
[[https://www.gandi.net/][gandi]]. As a first-time customer, I've been pleasantly surprised! Their pricing
is fair, their cPanel is straightforward, they don't seem to use trackers on
their website, DNSSEC is really easy to enable and they support [[https://docs.gandi.net/en/account_management/security/security_key.html][security keys]]
for MFA! ðŸŽ‰

I've previously used [[https://www.namecheap.com/][namecheap.com]] and the swedish domain registrar [[https://www.loopia.se/][loopia.se]].
Namecheap was okay, they are generally very cheap and their cPanel is okay. I
was quite disappointed with Loopia from the start, which is why I ever only
registered 1 domain with them. They are quite expensive and they don't even
support any form of 2FA/MFA. And no, I don't view having [[https://www.bankid.com/][BankID]] as a good reason
to skip providing MFA for other types of login.

In general I don't really like the state of affairs when it comes to domain
registrars. They always try to upsell you on extra features (or even new
domains!), and they all seem to track you for unknown reasons. It's a bit sad to
see both [[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock][uBlock Origin]] and [[https://privacybadger.org/][Privacy Badger]] being on high alert when I'm adding an
A-record through their cPanel.

*** Migration
Currently, I'm hosting an out-dated version of this website at my old domain
[[https://datamaskin.se][datamaskin.se]] in addition to this new website. When that domain expires (Feb
12 2024), the old site will be forever unavailable and redacted from this blog
post.

:EXPORT_TITLE: Mullvad Application
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: /
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: mullvad
:END:
Hello there, moles! ðŸ‘‹

This is the cover letter for my formal application to Mullvad.

My name is Markus Pettersson. If you haven't already, check the [[/about][About section]] to
find out more about who I am. In short, I'm a 24 years old software engineer who
loves open source, well-written documentation, functional programming &
specialty coffee â˜•

But now, let's get to the interesting bits: *Why am I applying to work at
Mullvad?* Because I think that you are genuinely a good workplace for someone
like me. I want to do something meaningful as an engineer, but sadly, I think
lots of time & resources are spent developing things that are not meaningful. In
my opinion, technology should be used for the common good, not the wealthy few.
Software should serve the users, not corporate stakeholders. And maybe most
importantly, software should work well, which requires attention,
conscientiousness and respect for the craft that is programming.

My image of Mullvad grew during my studies at Chalmers, where I got to talk to
some smart people who also happened to take privacy seriously. They used
Mullvad, because your VPN is transparent and works well with truly minimal
intrusion. Auto-generated account numbers, pay by mailing cash and the banner on
your site that tells whether the user is browsing from a secure connection. All
these things feel so obvious, but they show how far ahead you are compared to
competing VPN services in actually caring about the end user's best interest.

I also remember reading the blog post [[https://mullvad.net/sv/blog/2019/8/7/open-source-firmware-future/][Open source firmware is the future]], which
coincided with me exploring if I could get my hands on one of the early RISC-V
SBCs to deploy in my homelab. I remember feeling the desire to work at a place
where such thoughts are taking seriously: as fundamental as computers are in
today's society, they have no right to be the black boxes that they currently
are.

*What I can bring to the table* is a genuine interest in making the world a
little better, one line of code at a time. As far as I can tell, my personal
beliefs align well with Mullvad's core values, which I've come to learn is
crucial for my motivation & happiness. Therefore, I am confident that a career
at Mullvad could become a sustainable, long-term investment for both parties.

I enjoy learning new technologies, especially programming languages. I try to
attend as many local developer meetups as I can manage, among them the [[https://www.meetup.com/rustgbg/?_cookie-check=Tn0Gtbp-Fc9o1EMt][Rust Gbg]]
meetups where I've bumped into your guy: Linus FÃ¤rnstrand. As a self-proclaimed
polyglot with [[/cv.pdf][professional experience from all-over the tech stack-spectrum]], I
have an easy time to pick up new skills & tools as needed.

Personally, I think this application is way overdue, and I'm happy that I
finally took the plunge. My hopes are that we can engage in a closer
conversation soon.

Until then, stay hidden out there ðŸ‘‹
