Welcome stranger!
[[/about][I'm Markus]].

This is where I share pieces of myself: [[/blog][blog posts]], [[/resume][my resume]], open source projects and so on.

** Me
*Markus Pettersson*, 24 y.o. *software engineer* living in *Gothenburg*,
*Sweden*. Born and raised in Arvika, where my journey of building computers and
tinkering with electronics began. Computers & video games allowed me to stay
connected with my friends, and so I grew very fond of these machines. Learning
to tinker with them was not only fascinating in itself, but you could save a
few {{{abbr(sek, Swedish Crowns)}}} by building your own computer, which was
important for a kid whose only significant income consisted of birthday gifts
and christmas presents.

It was not really until last year of upper secondary school that I wrote my
first line of code. Which is weird, since I always wanted to get into game
development. I guess it was because I did not know how to approach the subject,
nor did anyone around me until then. That was until this great and super
passionate teacher, Stefan Holm, showed me how to write Basic, C and a bit of
C++. He introduced me to the clever humor of Douglas Adams, the sarcasm of [[https://xkcd.com/][xkcd]],
and communities of programmers such as [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]]. A whole new world opened
right in front of my eyes, and I've been hooked ever since.

I will be forevery grateful for free and open source software, from where I
could keep learning about the things I like the most. I am certain the
communities around open source projects changed my life for the better.

** Interests, motivation
My interest lie in *programming languages* and *developer tools*.
Who doesn't like when computers do arduous, and maybe even valuable work for them?
If computers can not automate a certain process, they should at least gently guide the user through the process.
That's why I appreciate projects like [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]], that build on a collective of knowledge from a truly *open community* to reshape the old and crude ways of working, in this case for systems programming.
Now that I think about it, I haven't heard the phrase "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazvK39Oc4U][Bending the Curve]]" in a while.
Maybe Rust's ideas about safety has become more and more normalized since its 1.0 release.
What do I know.

To strengthen my knowledge about *functional programming*, *type theory*,
*compilers* and all of that jazz I enrolled in the [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/pages/computer-science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx][Computer Science master at
Chalmers]] in 2020, which I'm about to graduate from this year (hopefully). It
has been a great experience, with lots of interesting courses and
lecturers/professors. I would claim that it has greatly improved my in-depth
knowledge on all of the aforementioned topics. I've learnt how a compiler works,
and I would even go so far as to say that I know what a {{{abbr(monad, A monad
is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\, also known as a 'burrito'
among domain experts.)}}} is. I hope to use my skills to build [[https://kristoff.it/blog/software-you-can-love/][software you can
love]] one day, I'll just have to figure out what that could be.

:EXPORT_TITLE: Mullvad Application

:END:
Hello there, moles! ðŸ‘‹

This is the cover letter for my formal application to Mullvad.

My name is Markus Pettersson. If you haven't already, check the [[/about][About section]] to
find out more about who I am. In short, I'm a 24 years old software engineer who
loves open source, well-written documentation, functional programming &
specialty coffee â˜•

But now, let's get to the interesting bits: *Why am I applying to work at
Mullvad?* Because I think that you are genuinely a good workplace for someone
like me. I want to do something meaningful as an engineer, but sadly, I think
lots of time & resources are spent developing things that are not meaningful. In
my opinion, technology should be used for the common good, not the wealthy few.
Software should serve the users, not corporate stakeholders. And maybe most
importantly, software should work well, which requires attention,
conscientiousness and respect for the craft that is programming.

My image of Mullvad grew during my studies at Chalmers, where I got to talk to
some smart people who also happened to take privacy seriously. They used
Mullvad, because your VPN is transparent and works well with truly minimal
intrusion. Auto-generated account numbers, pay by mailing cash and the banner on
your site that tells whether the user is browsing from a secure connection. All
these things feel so obvious, but they show how far ahead you are compared to
competing VPN services in actually caring about the end user's best interest.

I also remember reading the blog post [[https://mullvad.net/sv/blog/2019/8/7/open-source-firmware-future/][Open source firmware is the future]], which
coincided with me exploring if I could get my hands on one of the early RISC-V
SBCs to deploy in my homelab. I remember feeling the desire to work at a place
where such thoughts are taking seriously: as fundamental as computers are in
today's society, they have no right to be the black boxes that they currently
are.

*What I can bring to the table* is a genuine interest in making the world a
little better, one line of code at a time. As far as I can tell, my personal
beliefs align well with Mullvad's core values, which I've come to learn is
crucial for my motivation & happiness. Therefore, I am confident that a career
at Mullvad could become a sustainable, long-term investment for both parties.

I enjoy learning new technologies, especially programming languages. I try to
attend as many local developer meetups as I can manage, among them the [[https://www.meetup.com/rustgbg/?_cookie-check=Tn0Gtbp-Fc9o1EMt][Rust Gbg]]
meetups where I've bumped into your guy: Linus FÃ¤rnstrand. As a self-proclaimed
polyglot with [[/cv.pdf][professional experience from all-over the tech stack-spectrum]], I
have an easy time to pick up new skills & tools as needed.

Personally, I think this application is way overdue, and I'm happy that I
finally took the plunge. My hopes are that we can engage in a closer
conversation soon.

Until then, stay hidden out there ðŸ‘‹

This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.

I intended to start this project way back when [[https://blog.google/technology/developers/hello-dev/][Google released .dev domains to the public]].
I managed to register a =.dev= domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him. How time flies.

I do not know what this site will be used for, except for hosting my resume and a few links to portfolis such as Github, in case anyone would care.
Maybe I'll get around to document my foray into ergonomic keyboards, or write about esoteric programming languages I find interesting.

Until next time.
