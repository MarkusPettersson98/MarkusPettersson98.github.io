Look into adding tags to the config file.

** TODO ox-hugo
+ Set the ~org-hugo-base-dir~ variable in a ~.dir-locals.el~ or File Local Variables.

I did mention this in my [[file:~/Projects/me/site/content/blog/initial-commit.md][first blog post]].

** TODO Add Keyboards
It would be fun to document / discuss keyboards on my site.
