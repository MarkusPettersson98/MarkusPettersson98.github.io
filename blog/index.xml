It has multiple qualities which I like
It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat short It&amp;rsquo;s obscure enough that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this particular wordplay on &amp;ldquo;Markus&amp;rdquo; before, which makes it feel a tad bit more authentic It&amp;rsquo;s personal enough that I actually would want to use it as my personal email domain Since registering the domain on Nov 19 I&amp;rsquo;ve already comitted to it far more than my previous domain, for example associating it with my GPG key ðŸ”‘.</description></item><item><title>Initial Commit</title><link>https://marqs.io/blog/initial-commit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hi@marqs.io (Markus Pettersson)</author><guid>https://marqs.io/blog/initial-commit/</guid><description>This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.
I intended to start this project way back when Google released .dev domains to the public. I managed to register a .dev domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him.</description></item></channel></rss>
