It has multiple qualities which I like
It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat short It&amp;rsquo;s obscure enough that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this particular wordplay on &amp;ldquo;Markus&amp;rdquo; before, which makes it feel a tad bit more authentic It&amp;rsquo;s personal enough that I actually would want to use it as my personal email domain Since registering the domain on Nov 19 I&amp;rsquo;ve already comitted to it far more than my previous domain, for example associating it with my GPG key ðŸ”‘.</description></item><item><title>Initial Commit</title><link>https://marqs.io/blog/initial-commit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hi@marqs.io (Markus Pettersson)</author><guid>https://marqs.io/blog/initial-commit/</guid><description>This marks the start of my very own personal blog. Finally.
I intended to start this project way back when Google released .dev domains to the public. I managed to register a .dev domain containing my name for several years without doing anything fruitful with it. I even managed to talk a friend into buying such a domain for himself, with the promise that I would host his personal website for him.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://marqs.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hi@marqs.io (Markus Pettersson)</author><guid>https://marqs.io/about/</guid><description>Me Markus Pettersson, 25 y.o. software engineer living in Gothenburg, Sweden currently working for Mullvad VPN. Raised in Arvika, where my journey of building computers and tinkering with electronics began. Computers &amp;amp; video games allowed me to stay connected with my friends, despite growing up in a rural area, and I quickly grew very fond of these machines. Learning to tinker with them was not only fascinating in itself, but building your own gaming computer was more cost effective than buying a pre-built dito.</description></item><item><title>Mullvad Application</title><link>https://marqs.io/mullvad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hi@marqs.io (Markus Pettersson)</author><guid>https://marqs.io/mullvad/</guid><description>Hello there, moles! ðŸ‘‹
